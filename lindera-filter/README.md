Character and token filters for [Lindera](https://github.com/lindera-morphology/lindera).

## Character filters

### Japanese iteration mark character filter

Normalizes Japanese horizontal [iteration marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration_mark) (odoriji) to their expanded form.
Sequences of iteration marks are supported. In case an illegal sequence of iteration marks is encountered, the implementation emits the illegal source character as-is without considering its script. For example, with input "?„Çù", we get "??" even though the question mark isn't hiragana.

Replace characters with the specified character mappings, and correcting the resulting changes to the offsets.
Matching is greedy (longest pattern matching at a given point wins). Replacement is allowed to be the empty string.
