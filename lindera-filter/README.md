Character and token filters for [Lindera](https://github.com/lindera-morphology/lindera).

## Character filters

### Japanese iteration mark filter

Normalizes Japanese horizontal [iteration marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration_mark) (odoriji) to their expanded form.
Sequences of iteration marks are supported. In case an illegal sequence of iteration marks is encountered, the implementation emits the illegal source character as-is without considering its script. For example, with input "?„Çù", we get "??" even though the question mark isn't hiragana.

### Mapping filter

Replace characters with the specified character mappings, and correcting the resulting changes to the offsets.
Matching is greedy (longest pattern matching at a given point wins). Replacement is allowed to be the empty string.

### Regex filter

Character filter that uses a regular expression for the target of replace string.

Unicode normalization to normalize the input text, that using the specified normalization form, one of NFC, NFD, NFKC, or NFKD.
